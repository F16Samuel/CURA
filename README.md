# 🧠 CURA - AI-Powered Health Assistant

CURA is a smart, AI-driven web platform that connects patients and doctors through seamless communication and instant preliminary health consultations. It integrates an ML model to analyze symptoms and generate helpful insights, which are then packaged into a well-structured PDF report for doctors. Appointments are managed with distinct dashboards for both patients and healthcare professionals.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **AI Health Consultation**  
  Patients describe their symptoms, and an AI model provides intelligent predictions and suggestions.

- 🧾 **Automated PDF Report**  
  All patient responses and AI-generated outputs are compiled into a clean PDF sent to the doctor before the appointment.

- 👨‍⚕️ **Dual Dashboard Access**  
  - **Patients:** Request appointments and view reports.  
  - **Doctors:** View upcoming appointments and access patient-submitted forms + PDFs.

- 🗂️ **Backend Data Handling**  
  Django backend receives form data, processes it, and generates PDFs.

- 🧠 **Integrated Machine Learning Model**  
  Built-in multi-layered ML model powered by PyTorch (3-layer decision system).
